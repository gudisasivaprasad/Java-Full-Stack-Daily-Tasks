2.Relational operators
======================
•Relational operators are also called as comparison operators.

•Relational operators are used in where clause only.

•Oracle SQL having following relational operators.
 =,<,<=,>,>=,<> or !=

syntax:-
=======
select * from tablename
where columnname relationaloperator value;



 *
*** Where clause is used to filtering the rows or restricting the 
 *          records purpose we are using.

Note:-Generally in all relational databases we are not allowed to use
      column aliasname in where clause.


column aliasname: It is used to change column heading in final output.
=================

•To give column aliasname we use AS keyword.(Using AS is optional) 
 

•To give column aliasname as multiple words,use double quotes (").

EG:-
===
 sal*12 as "ann sal"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.LOGICAL OPERATORS
===================
 if you want to specify more than one condition in where clause then we are
using either AND or by using logical operator OR.



syntax:-select * from tablename
======  where condition1 and condition2;


syntax:-select * from tablename
======   where condition1 or condition2;
