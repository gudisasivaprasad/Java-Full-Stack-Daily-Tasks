                                 CLAUSES TASK
                                ==============


GROUP BY:- Group by clause is used to divide similar data items
=========  into set of logical groups. And also group by clause    
           reduces no of rows in each group.

Syntax:-select columnname.......
======  from tablename 
        group by columnname;

Execution order:-
==============
1.FROM 
2.WHERE
3.GROUP BY 
4.HAVING
5.SELECT
6.ORDER BY


RULE:- Other than group function columns specified after select
=====  then those all columns must be specified after group by.
       Otherwise oracle server returns an error not a GROUP BY 
       expression.

EX1:-
==== 
    SQL>select deptno,job
        from emp
        group by deptno,job;

Note:- In all relational databases we can also use group by clause
=====   without using group functions.

HAVING Clause:- After group by clause we are not allowed to use where
=============   clause. In place of this one ANSI/ISO SQL provided
                another clause having.
               
Generally if we want to restrict the rows in a table then we are using 
where clause whereas if we want to restrict groups after group by
then we must use having clause.

Generally we are not allowed to use group functions in where clause 
whereas we can also use group functions in having clause.
