c) Substituting a character string in a text expression
   with a specified string

d) Finding the number of characters in an expression



Answer: 

### a) Combining more than two columns or expressions into a single column in the output  
❌ **Not counted here**

- `CONCAT()` function in Oracle **combines only TWO arguments**
- More than two columns usually done using `||` **operator**, not a single function
- So this option is **not correct as per function definition**

---

### b) Displaying a date in a non-default format  
✅ **Correct**

- Done using **`TO_CHAR(date,'format')`**
- Example:
```sql
TO_CHAR(hiredate,'DD-MON-YYYY')
```

---

### c) Substituting a character string in a text expression with a specified string  
✅ **Correct**

- Done using **`REPLACE()`**
- Example:
```sql
REPLACE('HELLO WORLD','WORLD','SQL')
```

---

### d) Finding the number of characters in an expression  
✅ **Correct**

- Done using **`LENGTH()`**
- Example:
```sql
LENGTH(ename)
```

---

## ✅ **Final Correct Answers (Choose three):**
**b, c, d**

---

### 🧠 Exam memory line:
> **SQL functions can format, replace, and measure data**
