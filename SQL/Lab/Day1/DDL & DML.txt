                             ================

1.Create a STUDENT table with the following columns

-----> SID

-----> SNAME

-----> GENDER

-----> FEE

3.insert records into the STUDENT table.


4.Write a query to add a new student record with the NAME 'SURYA' 
  and a FEE of 30000 into the STUDENT table.


5.Write a query to display all the records from the STUDENT table.

1.What is DATABASE ?

 Database is a place where we can store structured collection
 of inter related data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.What is SQL ?

  SQL is structured query language.in sql we are writing queries.
with the help of queries we are communicating with the database.

  SQL language was introduced by E.F Codd. He was a mathematician that's
why he was represented data in the format of matrix(rows and columns).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.What are DDL commands ? What is the purpose of create command ?

• DDL stands for Data Definition Language

• DDL command are used to define structure of the 
  table.

• The following are the DDL commands.

1)Create                   
2)Alter
3)Drop                     
4)Flashback                
5)Truncate
6)Purge
7)Rename (oracle 9i)

1)Create:- create command is used to create database objects like 
=========  tables, views, sequences, indexes,views, 
           procedures,functions.....etc 


Creating a table:-
=================
syntax:-
========
create table tablename(columnname1 datatype(size),columnname2 datatype(size).... );

NOTE:-By default DDL commands are auto committed.No need to give any commit
===== command explicitly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.What are DML commands

• DML stands for Data Manipulation Language.

• DML commands are used to manipulate data in a table.

• Simply in DML all operations we are performing on data.

• The following are the DML commands.

1.Insert
2.Update
3.Delete
4.Merge (oracle 9i)




1)insert: It is used to insert data into a table.
========

Method1:-
========
insert into tablename values(value1,value2,.......);


Method2:-(Using Substitutional operator)
========

    &------>Enter value for

Same like scanf function in C language.i.e is used to read
the values from the keyboard.

Here also '&' it is used to read the values from the keyboard.

syntax:-
=======
insert into tablename values(&col1,&col2.....);


Method3(Skipping columns):-in first 2 methods we need to provide values
=========================  for all the columns then only record is
                           inserted.

•For EG 10 columns are there i am interested to give values for only 3
 columns then we are using Skipping column method.

syntax:-
=======
insert into tablename(col1,col2....)values(value1,value2....);

NOTE:-DML commands are not auto commit commands.after inserting data use commit
====  command then only data is saved permanently in database.
