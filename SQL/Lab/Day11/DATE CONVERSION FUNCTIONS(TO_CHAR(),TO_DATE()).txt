                          DATE CONVERSION FUNCTIONS
                        ===========================

1)to_char():-it is used to convert oracle date type into character type.


EX:-
===
SQL> select to_char(sysdate,'DAY MONTH YYYY') from dual;

TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'DAYMONTHYYYY')
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEDNESDAY JANUARY   2026

SQL> select to_char(sysdate,'day')from dual;

TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'DAY')
------------------------------------
wednesday



NOTE:- Basically to_char() character formats are case sensitive formats.
====
       
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
1.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in the year 1981 from emp table using to_char()?



2.Write a query to display employee names,Hiredate and 4 digit year from emp table
  by using to_char()?

EXCEPTED OUTPUT:-
===============

   ENAME      HIREDATE       YEAR
 --------    ----------     ------   
  SMITH       17-DEC-80      1980
  ALLEN       20-FEB-81      1981
  -----        -------       ----
  -----        -------       ----
  -----        -------       ----
  MILLER      23-JAN-82      1982



3.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in the month DECEMBER
  from emp table by using to_char() month format?


NOTE:-Whenever we are using to_char() MONTH format oracle server
      internally allocates maximum 9 bytes for MONTH field.
whenever passed MONTH having less number of bytes then oracle server
does not return any rows.To overcome this problem then we must use
fm(fill mode).



4.Write a query to display the employees records who are joined in 1980,1982,1984
  from emp table by using to_char()?



5.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in the month FEBRUARY
  from emp table by using to_char() MM format ?



6.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in JAN,MAR,DEC months
  from emp table by using to_char()?



7.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in 1981 DECEMBER 
  from emp table by using to_char()?



8.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in 1st and 4th quarter 
  from emp table by using to_char()?



9.Write a query to display the employees who joined in 1st quarter of 1981
  from emp table by using to_char()?




10.Write a query to display employee names,hiredate and DAY of join(which day they are join) 
   from emp table?



11.Write a query to display the employees who are joining on SUNDAY from emp table?



12.Write a query to display the employees who are joining before 15th of every month 
   from emp table using to_char()?



13.Write a query to display the employee records who are joined in leap year
   from emp table?


14.Write a query to find which day india got independence



15.Write a query which is used to add 5 days to the given date
  '09-feb-05'



16.Write a query which is used to add 5 days to the given date
  '09-02-05'


In Oracle whenever we are inserting dates into date data type column then oracle server automatically converts date string into date type when inserted date string is in oracle date format. Otherwise oracle server returns an error. To overcome this problem also then we must 
use to_date().

Eg:-
====
SQL> create table test1(col1 date);

SQL> insert into test1 values(sysdate); 

SQL> select * from test1;

COL1
------------
24-MAR-15

SQL> insert into test1 values('15-aug-05'); 

SQL> select * from test1;

COL1
------------
24-MAR-15
15-AUG-05

SQL> insert into test1 values('15-08-05');
Error: not a valid month

SQL> insert into test1 values(to_date('15-08-05','DD-MM-YY'));
1 row inserted

SQL> insert into test1 values('31/12/06');
Errot: not a valid month

SQL> insert into test1 values(to_date('31/12/06','DD/MM/YY'));
1 row inserted

SQL> select * from test1; 

COL1
------------
26-AUG-24
15-AUG-05
15-AUG-05
31-DEC-06
