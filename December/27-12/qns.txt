Problem Description
1) Write a Java program to demonstrate constructor overloading by creating a class Student.
The program should accept input from the user and initialize objects using different constructors based on the provided input.
Display the student details for each object.

Examples
Example 1
Input:
2
101
Ravi
Output:
Student Details:
Student ID   : 101
Student Name : Ravi
Student Age  : 0
Explanation:
System.out.println("Choose Constructor"); System.out.println("1. Default Constructor"); System.out.println("2. Constructor with ID and Name"); System.out.println("3. Constructor with ID, Name and Age");

3) Write a Java program to create a class called Account with instance variables accountNumber accountHolderName and balance.
 Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes these variables with the following validations:
	1) accountNumber should not be empty.
	2) balance should not be negative.
Print an error message if the validation fails.

Examples
Example 1
Input:
Account Number: ACC101
Account Holder: Ravi
Balance: 5000
